You'll wait a long, long time for anything much
 To happen in heaven beyond the floats of cloud
 And the Northern Lights that run like tingling nerves.
 The sun and moon get crossed, but they never touch,
 Nor strike out fire from each other nor crash out loud.
 The planets seem to interfere in their curves
 But nothing ever happens, no harm is done.
 We may as well go patiently on with our life,
 And look elsewhere than to stars and moon and sun
 For the shocks and changes we need to keep us sane.
 It is true the longest drought will end in rain,
 The longest peace in China will end in strife.
 Still it wouldn't reward the watcher to stay awake
 In hopes of seeing the calm of heaven break
 On his particular time and personal sight.
 That calm seems certainly safe to last to-night.
